            "explanation": "    What's happened to the Sun?    Sometimes it looks like the Sun is being viewed through a giant   lens.    In the featured video, however, there are actually millions of tiny lenses:  ice crystals.   Water may freeze in the   atmosphere into small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals.   As these crystals flutter to the ground, much time is spent with their  faces flat and parallel to the ground.   An observer may find themselves in the same plane as  many of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset.   During this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens,  refracting sunlight into our  view and creating  phenomena like parhelia, the technical term for  sundogs.    The  featured video was taken a month ago  on the side of a ski hill at the  Vemdalen Ski Resort in central   Sweden.  Visible in the center is the most direct image of the  Sun, while two bright  sundogs glow prominently from both the left and the right.    Also visible is the bright 22 degree halo -- as well as the rarer and much fainter  46 degree halo --  also created by  sunlight reflecting off of atmospheric ice  crystals."

            "explanation": "   Why does the Perseus galaxy cluster shine so strangely in one specific color of X-rays?  No one is sure, but a much-debated hypothesis holds that these  X-rays  are a clue to the long-sought identity of  dark matter.  At the center of this mystery is a 3.5  Kilo-electronvolt  (KeV) X-ray color that appears to glow excessively only when regions well outside  the cluster center are observed,  whereas the area directly surrounding a likely central  supermassive black hole is  actually deficient in 3.5 keV X-rays.  One  proposed resolution  -- quite controversial --  is that something never seen before might be present:  fluorescent dark matter (FDM).  This form of  particle dark matter might be able to absorb 3.5 keV X-radiation.   If operating, FDM, after absorption,  might later emit these X-rays from all over the cluster, creating an  emission line.  However, when seen  superposed in front of the central region  surrounding the black hole,  FDM's absorption would be more prominent, creating an  absorption line.    Pictured, a composite image of the  Perseus galaxy cluster shows visible and radio light in red, and  X-ray light from the Earth-orbiting  Chandra Observatory in blue."

            "explanation": "    Will our Sun look like this one day?    The Helix Nebula is one of brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula, a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star.  The outer gasses of the star expelled into space appear from our vantage point as if we are looking down a helix.  The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic  it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce.  The Helix Nebula, given a technical designation of NGC 7293, lies about 700 light-years away towards the constellation of the Water Bearer (Aquarius) and spans about 2.5 light-years.  The featured picture was taken with the  Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) located atop a dormant volcano in Hawaii,  USA.  A close-up of the inner edge of the Helix Nebula shows complex gas knots of unknown origin."
