            "explanation": "     Take this simulated plunge and dive into the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the Solar System's ruling gas giant.  The awesome animation is based on image data from JunoCam, and the microwave radiometer on board the Jupiter-orbiting Juno spacecraft.  Your view will start about 3,000 kilometers above the southern Jovian cloud tops, but you can track your progress on the display at the left.  As altitude decreases, temperature increases while you dive deeper at the location of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot.  In fact, Juno data indicates the Great Red Spot, the Solar System's largest storm system, penetrates some 300 kilometers into the giant planet's atmosphere.  For comparison, the deepest point for planet Earth's oceans is just under 11 kilometers down.  Don't panic though, you'll fly back out again."

            "explanation": "    Earth's annual Geminid meteor shower did not disappoint as our fair planet plowed through dust from active asteroid 3200 Phaethon.  Captured in this northern hemisphere nightscape, the meteors stream away from the shower's radiant in Gemini.  To create the image, 37 individual frames recording meteor streaks were taken over period of 8.5 hours during the night of December 12/13.  In the final composite they were selected and registered against the starry sky above a radio telescope dish of MUSER, a solar-dedicated radio telescope array at astronomically-named Mingantu Station in Inner Mongolia, China, about 400 kilometers from Beijing.  Sirius, alpha star of Canis Major, shines brightly just above the radio dish and the Milky Way stretches toward the zenith.  Yellowish Betelgeuse is a standout in Orion to the right of the northern Milky Way.  The shower's radiant is at top left, high above the horizon near Castor and Pollux the twin stars of Gemini.  The radiant effect is due to perspective as the parallel meteor tracks appear to converge in the distance.   Gemini's meteors enter Earth's atmosphere traveling at about 22 kilometers per second."

            "explanation": "    Four Geminids flash through northern skies in this wintry night skyscape.  The bright fireball and 3 fainter meteors were captured in a single 10 second exposure, near the peak of December's Geminid meteor shower.  Reflecting the fireball's greenish light, a partially frozen Lake Edith in Alberta Canada's Jasper National Park lies in the foreground, with the Canadian Rocky Mountains ranging along the northern horizon.  Of course, the glacial lake is cold even in summer.  But photographer Jack Fusco reports that he experienced -9 degree C temperatures that night while enjoying one of the most active meteor showers he's ever seen."

            "explanation": "    Most galaxies have a single nucleus -- does this galaxy have four?    The strange answer leads  astronomers  to conclude that the nucleus of the surrounding galaxy is not even visible in  this image.    The central  cloverleaf is rather light emitted from a background  quasar.    The gravitational field of the visible foreground galaxy  breaks light  from this distant  quasar  into four distinct images.    The quasar must be  properly aligned  behind the center of a massive galaxy for a  mirage like this to be evident.    The general effect is known as  gravitational lensing, and this specific case is known as the  Einstein Cross.    Stranger still, the images of the  Einstein Cross vary in relative brightness,  enhanced occasionally by the additional  gravitational microlensing  effect of specific stars in the foreground galaxy."
